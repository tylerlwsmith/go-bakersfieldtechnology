					My name is <strong>Tyler Smith</strong>. I was born and raised here
					in Bakersfield, then started my career in the tech industry while
					living in Sacramento in 2015. As I progressed in my career, I got to
					work on websites for some of the most well-funded ballot initiative
					campaigns in California's history, and I built tools that empowered
					voters and legislative decision-makers. When I went independent, my
					first client was Stan Lee of Marvel Comics fame.
				</p>
				<p>
					I returned to Bakersfield in 2019 and I'm eager to share my skills
					with the community that shaped who I am.
